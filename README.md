# writers-block-crusher

As a published writer and English teacher in a past life, I know the struggles of Writer's Block and how frustrating it can be when you want to or have to write something and can't seem to find a reason why.

One of the things I would do for my students was something called "Flash Fiction."

Writers would be given 3 words and they would have a short amount of time to write a complete story in 300 words or less using all of the words given to them. I decided to a program to help combat writer's block or give writers a unique challenge of writing something with random works.

# I used https://random-words-api.vercel.app/word to generate the words on the customized UI.
